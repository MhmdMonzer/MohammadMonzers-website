                            <h3>School</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>During the ages of 4 to 6, I took my initial steps into the world of education at a private institution called Al
                                Takamul Kindergarten. This marked my very first encounter with school life, and let me tell you, my inaugural day was
                                nothing short of theatrical. As my mother bid me goodbye in the classroom, I found myself enveloped in tears, convinced
                                that I was being placed in some form of confinement. However, this perception quickly shifted when our teacher
                                distributed toys to all of us, granting a sense of comfort and solace.
                                Every morning, it was my father's ritual to accompany me to school, and without fail, he would ensure I started my day
                                on a delightful note by treating me to a delectable MANKOOSHET ZAATAR accompanied by a refreshing glass of pineapple
                                juice. These simple gestures not only filled my young heart with joy but also established a routine that I looked
                                forward to.
                                Amidst the routine, the educational journey continued. Within the walls of Al Takamul Kindergarten, I not only explored
                                the realms of play and fun but also embarked on the exciting path of learning. The foundation of my linguistic skills
                                took shape as I was introduced to the alphabets of both Arabic and English. Furthermore, the world of numbers unfolded
                                before me, stretching from one to ten.
                                Those formative years in Al Takamul Kindergarten painted the canvas of my early education with vivid memories of tears,
                                laughter, toys, MANKOOSHET ZAATAR, pineapple juice, alphabets, and numbers. Looking back, it was within those classrooms
                                that I took my first strides into a lifelong journey of learning and growth.</li>

                                <li>Upon completing my tenure at kindergarten, the next chapter of my educational journey unfolded  primary school. While
                                the physical setting transitioned to a different building, the school remained unchanged. The proximity of the new
                                building to the old one made the shift seem like a mere step forward.
                                One silver lining on that initial day was the presence of my older brother, who was already a part of the primary
                                school. His reassuring guidance eased my transition, providing insight into the school's dynamics and instilling
                                confidence by imparting the rules of the game.
                                These years proved to be the cornerstone of my educational voyage, forming the longest and most pivotal phase of
                                learning. During this period, I delved into the rudiments of various subjects. Math introduced me to operators, while
                                English grammar laid the foundation for effective communication.
                                Amidst the academic pursuits, friendships blossomed. New faces became familiar, and these relationships brought with
                                them a collection of experiences that remain etched in my memory. As I reflect upon those formative years, it's evident
                                that they were a catalyst for my growth, imparting knowledge, forging bonds, and etching experiences that continue to
                                shape me today.</li>
                                
                                <li>After completing primary school, my educational journey led me to middle school, still within the realm of Al Takamul
                                but in a different section. A notable shift was the schedule, as I embarked on afternoon classes. The clock struck 12
                                pm, marking my arrival at school, and the day's learning continued until 6 pm, when I returned home. This shift in
                                schedule was a new experience, altering the rhythm of my school routine.
                                The content of the lessons underwent a transformation as well. Complexity escalated as subjects delved deeper, posing
                                more challenges. Despite this, I found myself navigating through these challenges with relative ease. My dedication to
                                learning earned me a place in the top three spots on the mark sheet, a testament to my commitment as the biggest nerd in
                                the class.
                                A sense of continuity was fostered by my consistent circle of friends, who shared this educational journey with me,
                                moving through these grades side by side. Throughout these years, the teaching staff brought diversity to my educational
                                experience. Each teacher had a unique style of instruction. Some were mentors, treating us as their own, while others
                                taught with a personal touch that felt akin to parental guidance.
                                Perhaps unsurprisingly, I embraced the role of the teacher's pet, a distinction that seemed to be reciprocated by each
                                instructor. My quiet demeanor and academic dedication won the affection of the teachers, resulting in a harmonious
                                relationship between student and educator. In this environment, my identity as a quiet yet studious individual found a
                                home, a place where my dedication was both recognized and celebrated.</li>

                                <li>After successfully completing my middle school journey, I transitioned to high school, this time embarking on a new
                                adventure in a distinct institution known as Hussein Ali Nasser School. Here, amidst the halls and classrooms of this
                                new school, I forged some of the most cherished friendships that have colored my life.
                                The curriculum took a leap, diving into more advanced subjects. Concepts like calculus in math, genes in biology, and
                                acid-base reactions in chemistry entered the academic forefront. As the content grew more intricate, so did the
                                challenge, demanding a heightened level of engagement and effort.
                                However, in the midst of my educational voyage, an unprecedented shift occurred. The emergence of the Coronavirus, a
                                global pandemic, reshaped life as we knew it. The virus's rapid spread prompted a series of measures, including
                                quarantines and lockdowns. The impact was profound schools closed, societal norms shifted, and life entered a period
                                of uncertainty.
                                The situation was exacerbated by an economic crisis in Lebanon, which further delayed the reopening of schools. Amidst
                                these turbulent times, I found myself navigating a landscape that was both demanding and unprecedented. A period of 2-3
                                years saw schools shuttered and life restricted, presenting challenges that seemed insurmountable.
                                Yet, here I stand, having traversed those intense years. How I managed to overcome these hurdles is a question that even
                                I struggle to answer. The journey was tumultuous, testing my resilience and adaptability. And while the path was fraught
                                with challenges, it was also one of growth, introspection, and the discovery of the strength within.</li>

                            <h3>University</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In the year 2022, a significant milestone marked the culmination of my school journey: graduation. This achievement was
                                earned through the successful completion of the 12th-grade government official exam in the general science track. The
                                culmination of this chapter was an embodiment of years of dedication, effort, and the pursuit of knowledge.
                                Fourteen years of my life were dedicated to the pursuit of education, an odyssey that began with alphabets and numbers,
                                gradually evolving into complex equations, intricate theories, and profound concepts. Each stage was a building block, a
                                step towards personal growth and intellectual enrichment.
                                As the journey led me to the precipice of adulthood, a new horizon emerged on the landscape: university. This juncture
                                wasn't merely a transition; it was the gateway to a realm where specialized knowledge and self-discovery awaited. The
                                multitude of options and potential majors beckoned, yet for me, the choice was clear.
                                Sitting before a desk with my trusty keyboard, mouse, and the glow of a screen in front of me felt like a natural
                                habitat. It was this affinity for the virtual realm that led me to make the decision that was as intuitive as it was
                                exciting I chose computer science. This field promised not only a realm of fascination and continuous learning but
                                also an avenue of ample opportunities and a promising salary.
                                The allure of computer science extended beyond its financial rewards. It promised the thrill of creation, the
                                satisfaction of solving complex puzzles, and the privilege of contributing to technological advancements. Moreover, it
                                presented a future-proof degree that resonated with the evolving landscape of the digital age.
                                As I embarked on this academic journey, I embraced the challenges and excitement it would undoubtedly bring. It wasn't
                                merely a path of career building, but a voyage towards realizing my passion and carving my unique niche in the expansive
                                world of technology. The years ahead hold the promise of growth, innovation, and the fulfillment of aspirations that
                                have been nurtured over time.</li>

                                <li>The inaugural day of university dawned with a sense of exhilaration and surprise. The Lebanese International University
                                unveiled itself in all its grandeur, leaving me awestruck by its sheer scale and beauty. The vast expanse was alive with
                                a diverse tapestry of people a mosaic of races, ages, and backgrounds converging within the embrace of this
                                educational haven.
                                The campus itself was a realm of wonder. It was a sanctuary adorned with lush gardens, tranquil woods, and even a few
                                delightful creatures, particularly the ever-present feline companions. The atmosphere was a symphony of nature's
                                serenity intertwined with the bustling energy of ambitious minds congregating in pursuit of knowledge.
                                The quest to find my first class was an adventure in its own right. Wandering through this expansive paradise, it took
                                me a good twenty minutes to decipher the labyrinthine layout. My destination was an underground realm, a distinct
                                section that stood apart from the main college building. The discovery was akin to unearthing a hidden treasure a
                                subterranean classroom that promised to be a sanctuary for growth and enlightenment.
                                As I navigated this sea of novelty, a wave of anticipation coursed through me. The enormity of the campus and the
                                diversity it encapsulated was emblematic of the exciting journey that lay ahead. This inaugural day was a testament to
                                the potential for discovery, the promise of camaraderie, and the thrill of embarking on a new chapter in my educational
                                odyssey.</li>

                                <li>My university experience introduced me to a multitude of individuals from all walks of life, and I formed connections
                                with each one of them. The initial year on campus unfolded as a whirlwind of excitement, characterized by an abundance
                                of joy, a plethora of events, and a diverse tapestry of people hailing from every corner of the globe.
                                The campus was a vibrant hub of activity, hosting a myriad of events that left a trail of cherished memories. From
                                cultural celebrations that showcased the rich tapestry of our global community to exhilarating tournaments that tested
                                our strategic minds and dexterity, the first year was a parade of experiences.
                                Among the array of events, the competitive spirit soared with championships in a variety of disciplines. Chess boards
                                witnessed intense mental battles, while ping pong paddles danced with precision and agility. These championships weren't
                                merely contests; they were platforms where friendships were forged, skills were honed, and the joy of both participation

                                My unwavering aspiration fuels a deep-seated commitment to mastering the realm of digital 2D drawing, to not just touch
                                its surface, but to explore its depths and complexities until I am well-versed in every stroke and shade. This journey
                                isn't just about creation; it's about transcribing emotions, narratives, and imagination onto the canvas of the digital
                                world.<br><br>
                                The canvas transforms into a stage as I venture into the world of animation. With every frame, I weave movement and life
                                into my creations, embracing the dynamic interplay of time and artistry. This exploration isn't just about mastering
                                software; it's about sculpting moments that resonate, that breathe life into characters and stories.<br><br>
                                The allure of 3D art beckons, promising to elevate my capabilities to new dimensions. The realm of CGI, where pixels
                                transform into breathtaking worlds and creatures, becomes my playground. I aim to wield 3D tools to craft environments,
                                characters, and scenes that evoke awe and immerse viewers in fantastical realms.<br><br>
                                Through dedication, experimentation, and countless hours of honing my craft, I strive to forge my very own artwork. Each
                                stroke of the stylus becomes a testament to progress, to the gradual evolution of skills that I cultivate with every
                                piece. The fusion of creativity and technique allows me to paint narratives and emotions that bridge the gap between
                                reality and imagination.<br><br>
                                The realm of animation extends beyond mere motion; it's a language of storytelling. As I delve into the intricacies of
                                animating, I shape tales that traverse cultures and emotions. The metamorphosis from still images to a symphony of
                                movement is a journey that reflects my artistic growth and unwavering resolve.<br><br>
                                Looking towards the horizon, I dream of crafting stories akin to manga, where words, art, and imagination intertwine. A
                                world of characters and plots beckons, awaiting my touch to transform the narrative into an immersive experience. The
                                journey of creating manga is one of patience, of nurturing worlds that captivate hearts and minds.<br><br>
                                In this odyssey, the path isn't straight; it's a tapestry of exploration, experimentation, and growth. Every project,
                                every creation, is a chapter in my artistic saga, a testament to the power of determination and the fulfillment of
                                creative dreams.
